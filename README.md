# learning-something-new

Welcome to **learning-something-new**! This repository is a personal journey through continuous learning, where I document new skills, concepts, and projects as I progress through online courses, tutorials, and experiments.

## About This Repository
This repository serves as a learning journal where I commit everything new I learn. It may include:
- Small projects or exercises from online courses
- Code snippets and experiments from tutorials
- Notes or documentation on new concepts

The main goal is to stay curious, practice consistently, and have a record of my growth as a learner.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized by topics or courses. Each folder corresponds to a specific area of learning or a course/tutorial, and it may contain:
- Source code
- Notes (if applicable)
- Links to the original course/tutorial

## Disclaimer
This repository is a work in progress. The code and notes are meant for personal learning and may not always follow best practices. Feedback is welcome to help me improve!

## Goals
- To commit regularly and stay consistent with learning.
- To track my progress over time.
- To share and inspire others who might be on a similar learning path.
